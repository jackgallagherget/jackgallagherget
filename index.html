		<p>Turtles that live in the ocean are called sea turtles. Different types of sea turtles can be found throughout the world and in every ocean except for the Arctic Ocean, which is too cold. Generally, sea turtles prefer warm seas and stay in shallow coastal areas like lagoons and bays, but they are sometimes found in deeper ocean waters as well.</p>
